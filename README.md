## Hi 👋 I'm Mirco Cardinale,

and I've recently obtained a BS in Computer Science. 

I'm passionate about NLP, machine learning in general, data science, languages and cultures. 

I'm also a Cultural Anthropology graduate.

I like digital humanities and the concept of applying computer science to humanist fields. 

Lately, I've been intrigued by the idea of using Deep Learning NLP models on edge devices.


### Things I do
---

- I’m currently working on applying NLP functionalities based on transformers models to my language learning [android app](https://github.com/cr1m5onk1ng/nala_android_app)
- I'm doing experiments with [semantic search](https://github.com/cr1m5onk1ng/semantic-search-api) and [text similarity](https://github.com/cr1m5onk1ng/text_similarity)
- I’m currently learning Rust for WASM, microservices and scientific computing
- I'm studying the most recent advances in NLP and I try to read papers on a weekly bases
- I learn languages for no particular reason
- I fail constantly and repeatedly before actually managing to achieve something

### Things I'd like to do
---

- I'd like to build useful things (possibly, things that work)
- I'd like to build things that can help someone do something
- I'd like to be able to say I'm good at math
