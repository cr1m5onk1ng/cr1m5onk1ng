## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mirco Cardinale,

and I'm a **Software Developer** and **Computer Science graduate**. 

I'm passionate about **NLP**, **app development**, **languages**. 

I'm also a **Cultural Anthropology** graduate.

Lately, I've been intrigued by the idea of building apps powered by **NLP functionalities**.

### Things I do
---
- Working on ****
- I'm doing some **experiments with [semantic search](https://github.com/cr1m5onk1ng/semantic-search-api) and [text similarity](https://github.com/cr1m5onk1ng/text_similarity)** 
- I keep following the **most recent advances in NLP** as much as I can
- Iâ€™m trying to **learn Rust** for fast and safe Android libraries integration and WASM development
- I **learn languages** for no particular reason

### Things I'd like to do
---
- I'd like to build useful things (possibly, things that work)
- I'd like to build things that can help someone do something
- I'd like to be able to say I'm good at math
